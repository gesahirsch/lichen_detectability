THIS FOLDER IS DELIBERATELY EMPTY.
Upon execution of the R-files in the folder 1_code/, the output generated from the occupancy models and the summary tables and figures produced will be stored here.

The execution of the provided code (1_code/*.R) will generate the figures and tables from the manuscript and supplementary materials in .tif (8 figures) and .csv (2 tables) format, and the model output in form of the following files:


#  output.jags_model.RData  #
#---------------------------#
output from the occupancy model 1_code/1a_run_jags_model.R stored as a file of class 'jagsUI'. All summary statistics in the manuscript as well as Appendix 2 are generated from this output.


#  output.jags_model_gof.RData  #
#-------------------------------#
output from the occupancy model 1_code/1b_run_jags_model_gof.R stored as a file of class 'jagsUI'. This output was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data.


#  output.jags_model_priors1.RData  #
#-----------------------------------#
output from the occupancy model 1_code/1c_run_jags_model_alternative_priors1.R stored as a file of class 'jagsUI'. This output was used for the prior sensitivity analysis reported in Appendix 1.


#  output.jags_model_priors2.RData  #
#-----------------------------------#
output from the occupancy model 1_code/1c_run_jags_model_alternative_priors2.R stored as a file of class 'jagsUI'. This output was used for the prior sensitivity analysis reported in Appendix 1.
